# boidsSim
This is a QT implementation of boids inspired from a JavaScript implementation by [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/boids).

In contrast to Ben Eater's implementation, where everyting is done in JavaScript, this implementation defines a C++ boids class which computes the position of the elements and a front end QML file which uses JavaScript canvas to animate the boids.
